Mass-Driver Non-Commercial License
==================================

v2.0 — May 5, 2021

General
-------

This End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a contract between
Mass-Driver and you, the Licensee (the entity or organisation on whose
behalf the Fonts are used, and whose name is specified during the
checkout or sale process).

By purchasing, downloading, installing or otherwise using the Fonts
(computer software containing representations of typeface designs), you
are agreeing to the terms of this Agreement.

Upon receipt of full payment of all applicable license fees, Mass-Driver
grants you the limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to use
the Fonts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You agree that
all rights not granted to you by this Agreement are expressly reserved
by Mass-Driver.

Non-Commercial License
----------------------

A Non-Commercial license permits you to use the Fonts for preview and
evaluation purposes, and in documents for personal use. The Fonts
included with a Non-Commercial license are the full versions, with no
reductions made to their character set or OpenType features, provided in
OTF (OpenType CFF) format.

A Non-Commercial license permits you to install the Fonts on any number
of devices within your organisation.

You are permitted to use the Fonts in self-initiated, non-commercial
work. This includes student work, provided it is not performed on behalf
of a third party (such as a live brief for a commercial client). You may
post this work on social media, on the condition that you credit both
Mass-Driver and the name of the typeface within the post.

You are permitted to use the Fonts in the creation of design proposals
you submit to a client, even if this would constitute a commercial use.

General Restrictions
--------------------

You must take all reasonable precautions to ensure the Fonts are not
accessible to unlicensed third parties or to the general public. The
Fonts must not be uploaded onto online storage platforms (such as GitHub
or Amazon S3) where they would be accessible to unlicensed third
parties.

You are not permitted to:

-   Decompile, modify, reverse-engineer, reformat, alter, edit, or
    create derivative works of the Fonts or engage any third party to do
    so without prior written permission from Mass-Driver;
-   Distribute (share, rent, lend, gift, sell, sublicense, etc.) the
    Fonts or any copy thereof to any unlicensed third party;
-   Transfer this Agreement or any of your rights hereunder to any third
    party without the prior written permission of Mass-Driver;
-   Use the Fonts in any explicitly political or religious context, or
    any context relating to cryptocurrency or the sale of Non-Fungible
    Tokens (NFTs), without the prior written consent of Mass-Driver;
-   Use the Fonts in any violent, hateful or discriminatory context;
-   Use the Fonts in any application in which an unlicensed third party
    could use them to customise their own designs or to create static
    documents or images (e.g. an online design application, iron-on
    lettering product, or print-on-demand service).

Term
----

This Agreement is effective in perpetuity, except that if you breach any
of its terms, Mass-Driver reserves the right to charge you the cost of a
license covering your actual usage of the Fonts, on a per-infringement
basis and without discounts, and/or terminate the license.

Warranty
--------

Mass-Driver makes no warranties, express or implied, as to
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or otherwise.

If you encounter an issue or problem with the Fonts, Mass-Driver will
make a good faith effort to provide a fix or replacement within 30 days
of being notified. If the issue cannot be reasonably remedied,
Mass-Driver may at their discretion offer to refund you, at which point
this Agreement will immediately terminate.

Mass-Driver shall in no event be liable to you or any other third party
for any direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages arising
out of the use or inability to use the Fonts, even if notified in
advance.

Under no circumstances shall Mass-Driver’s liability exceed the cost of
the license you purchased. You agree to indemnify and hold Mass-Driver
harmless from and against any claims or damage which may result from
your misuse of the Fonts or breach of this Agreement.

Legal
-----

This Agreement is subject to and governed by the laws of The
Netherlands. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between
Mass-Driver and you, and supersedes any prior discussions or
negotiations, whether verbal or in writing.

No amendment, modification or waiver will be valid or enforceable unless
materialised in an agreement signed by Mass-Driver.

If any part of this Agreement is found void or unenforceable, it will
not affect the validity of the rest of the Agreement, which shall remain
valid and enforceable according to its terms. Mass-Driver’s failure or
election not to enforce a provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of
its right to do so later.

The numberings and section titles within this Agreement are for
convenience and shall not affect or alter the meaning or construction of
any terms or provisions of the Agreement.
